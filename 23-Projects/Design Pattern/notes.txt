    Select

        Go's select lets you wait on multiple channel operations. 
		Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go

    mutex

        "A Mutex is a method used as a locking mechanism to ensure that only one Goroutine is accessing the critical section of code at any point of time. 
		This is done to prevent race conditions from happening. Sync package contains the Mutex. Two methods defined on Mutex. Lock."
